# example-ptc-issues
Example repository using issues for PTCs. 

- Each PTC is represented by an issue that is assigned a PTC label. 
- The current state of the PTCs are visible in the main issue list and the PSIP project. 
- Progress towards the PTC is tracked by opening issues related to each PTC item. These sub-issues are listed in the PTC and tracked on the main Developer project boad along with all the normal developer issues.
- Templates are available for creating PTCs

There are two styles of PTCs:
1. The first is the traditional style using a numbered score. This requires the developer to edit the PTC card and update the score.
2. The second is using checkboxes which can be updated without editing the card. However this may require the items to be restructured slightly so that they make sense.
